const YEET_PROMPT = `Commit and push the current repository changes.

Steps:
1. Add all unstaged changes with \`git add -A\`.
2. Inspect the staged changes and write a concise commit message that accurately summarizes them.
3. Commit the changes with that message.
4. Push the commit to the current branch's remote.
   - If the current branch does not have an upstream remote branch, create one by pushing with upstream tracking.
   - If this repository has no git remotes configured, do not push.
5. After pushing, output the remote URL for what was pushed if the repository has a remote.
   - If the current branch is \`main\`, output the normal remote repository URL.
   - If the current branch is not \`main\`, output a URL to create a pull request from the pushed branch into \`main\`.
   - Convert SSH git remotes like \`git@github.com:owner/repo.git\` to HTTPS URLs when printing.

Keep the commit message concise.`;
